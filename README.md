This game was made with lots of love as my Senior Capstone Project.  It's a short story-based Rhymthm Platforming game that uses a few of my favorite songs. This was my first ever Unity project and I had a ton of fun building it throughout my final semester

**To install the game:**

simply select the correct OS from the Builds folder and download the ZIP file inside

Once the ZIP is extracted, use the following path based on OS:
- Windows: Frog Hero/Rhythm Platformer.exe
- Apple: Frog Hero.app/Contents/MACOS/Rhythm Platformer

This will launch the game. Have fun & enjoy!

Please ensure that you leave the executable game file in the exact location from the download. Otherwise it will not open properly for you
